# Chess

## Ruby Final Project

The task is to build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.

$ Chess.new.play starts the game. Just name 'from' and 'to' squares to move pieces around (e.g. 'e2 e4').
At any time you can save or load the game by simply entering 'save' or 'load' command instead of naming selected squares (the game has one slot for saving).
You can also use 'draw' command to end the game, or 'exit' to simply leave it.

Enjoy!
